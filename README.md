# Attendance-System
An NFC-enabled, RFID based attendance system, with Face recognition as an added security measure.

To use this software, a database is required in MySQL which contains all the information of the people to be recognised. For demo purposes, Joe Biden is used. Along with that, the program is to be given the file path of the image of the correspondinng student to detect it. 

It then outputs the namme of the student and time of entry into the textfile attendance.txt
